# COBOL-Project-4---CAPSTONE
The program is HEALING-VIBES-PROG.cbl, but it is recommended to read the included word file which is the problem description. 
The general gist is that it reads from various files, performs data validation on those files, then creates new files to later read from.
After these new files are created, a final report is created to sort inventory supplies based on warehouse locations.

The final output is VIBE-REPORT.txt.
